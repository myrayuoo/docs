# Saving data

## Save
`save()` function can be used on localhost, but **does not** work on the cloud. To save data on the cloud use secure-save.

## Secure-Save
Secure-Save function is recommended and required to save data on the cloud. Call it by executing `ssave()` 2 times. It is advised that you check if the runtime and save values are the same before shutting down the server
